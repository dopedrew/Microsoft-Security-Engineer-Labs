# Logging Strategy (Lab)

## Objective
Centralize telemetry in Log Analytics + Sentinel to support detection and response.

## Data sources (examples)
- Microsoft Defender XDR / M365 Defender
- Entra ID sign-in + audit logs
- Azure Activity logs
- Endpoint telemetry (Defender for Endpoint)

## Principles
- Ingest only what you can defend + afford
- Tag and document data connector decisions
- Keep a cost/tuning log for Sentinel
