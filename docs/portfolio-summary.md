# Portfolio Summary

## Objective
Demonstrate Microsoft Security Engineer capability through hands-on engineering:
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR) deployment, detections, automation
- Microsoft Defender XDR investigations and advanced hunting
- Microsoft Entra ID identity protection & Conditional Access design
- Security automation with PowerShell + Logic Apps

## What I built
- Custom detections (KQL) mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Automated response playbooks (Logic Apps / SOAR)
- Architecture diagrams (telemetry flow + Zero Trust)
- End-to-end case studies using realistic attack scenarios

## How to review this repo
1. Start with `01-sentinel/` for SIEM engineering & detections
2. Review `02-defender-xdr/` for XDR investigations & hunting queries
3. Check `03-entra-id/` for identity controls and testing outcomes
4. Look at `incidents/completed/` for full incident lifecycle writeups
